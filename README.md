# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step 1: Import numpy to perform the inverse of matrix operation
### Step 2: Create the matrix to find the inverse,representing as a Numpy array
### Step 3: Use the numpy. linalg.det() function to ensure the determination of matrix is non-singular matrix have inverses
### Step 4: End the program

## Program:
```
#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.
#Developed by: SWETHA S V
#RegisterNumber: 212224230285
import numpy as np
a = np.array([[2,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,-1,2]])
b = np.linalg.inv(a)
print(b)
```
## Output:

## Result:
Thus the inverse of given matrix is successfully solved using python program
